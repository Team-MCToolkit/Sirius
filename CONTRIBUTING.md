# Tips
* **Prioritize bug fixes before new features**
* When committing, make sure to reference the issue by #ID in the commit message to link commits to the issue
* Reference potential issues the pull request relates to when an issue(s) related to the pull request exists
* Make sure to update files with license headers
* Consider checking and testing existing PRs and confirm they work as designed to help us avoid bugs
* Be human, we are humans too, keep the community positive when colaborating with contributors and maintainers :)
* Maintainers of this project do this for hobby. There might be cases of slow responses, or even inability to review or merge PR due to its scope and our (time) inability to review it properly or assist with changes needed to make it acceptable for merge.

# Pull requests

Once you complete your feature and are sure you followed the tips and tried to make the code blend in as much as possible, we will review the code.

Expect comments on code after the code review. You will likely need to change some code parts based on the maintainer's suggestions.

Some features might not be accepted into the core if they do not follow our guidelines, are low quality, or steer this project away from its purpose.

If maintainers are busy, it can take a few days (or more) to properly review your PR so please be patient ;)

Some pull request tips and standards:
* **Please separate different features in different pull requests**
* **Avoid big PRs.** They will be likely take much more time to review. Too big PRs might not be accepted due to amount of code reviewing and testing needed. Similar rule applies to PRs that significantly change core implementation.
* If possible, prepare a changelog of your pull request that is ready to be used in the final Sirius changelog

# CLA

Before we can use your code, you must sign the [Sirius CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/Team-MCToolkit/Sirius), which you can do online.
The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution 
becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure 
of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. 
You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and we approved it, but you must do it before
 we can put your code into our codebase.
